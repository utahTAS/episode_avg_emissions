## Script
episode_avg.py

## Purpose
Takes SMOKE reports and calculates the average-episode emissions (direct PM2.5, SO2, NOx, NH3, VOC) emitted in the "true" non-attainment area.

## Inputs
1) SMOKE reports (10 days * 4 sectors = **40 reports**) that are formatted a specific way.
2) Text file (1), generated by GIS, that determines which PM2.5 non-attainment area a 4 km grid-cell in the modeling domain belongs to.

## Output
Table of emission summaries by sector, pollutant, and non-attainment area (Salt Lake, Provo, Logan, N/A).
